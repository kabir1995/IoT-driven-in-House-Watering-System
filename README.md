# IoT-driven-in-House-Watering-System
Arduino| NodeMcu ESP8266| I2C | Master-slave| IoT
This project is an improvement of the conventional method of house garden watering system to the IoT driven in house garden watering system. The development of the system is divided into software and hardware implementation and it will cover these areas: -Arduino Uno Board, Node MCU ESP8266 and The Arduino programming language -The sensor system -The output system

In this project " firebase realtime database " is used as IoT platform.

Sensors: Soil sensor (3 pieces) | Ultrasonic sensor (HCSR04) (1 piece)

Actuator: DC Water Pump (3 pieces)

The I2C protocol is involved in this project to send analog sensors data from Arduno Uno to NodeMcu ESP8266.
